Do the task of the project "C-More functions, more nested loops"

TASKS :

0-isupper.c : Write a function that checks for uppercase character.
-Returns 1 if c is uppercase
-Returns 0 otherwise

1-isdigit.c : Write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
-Returns 1 if c is a digit
-Returns 0 otherwise

2-mul.c : Write a function that multiplies two integers.

3-print_numbers.c : Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

4-print_most_numbers.c : Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
-Do not print 2 and 4

5-more_numbers.c : Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

6-print_line.c : Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
- Where n is the number of times the character _ should be printed
- The line should end with a \n
- If n is 0 or less, the function should only print \n

7-print_diagonal.c : Write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.
- Where n is the number of times the character \ should be printed
- The diagonal should end with a \n
- If n is 0 or less, the function should only print a \n

8-print_square.c : Write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.
- Where size is the size of the square
- If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line
- Use the character # to print the square
