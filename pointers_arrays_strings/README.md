Do the task of the project "C-Pointers, arrays and strings"

TASKS :

Pointers, arrays and strings

0-reset_to_98.c : Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98

1-swap.c : Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.

2-strlen.c : Write a function that returns the length of a string.

3-puts.c : Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

4-print_rev.c : Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

5-rev_string.c : Write a function that reverses a string.

6-puts2.c : Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

7-puts_half.c : Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
- The function should print the second half of the string
- If the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last n characters of the string, where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2

8-print_array.c : Write a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
- where n is the number of elements of the array to be printed
- Numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space
- The numbers should be displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array

9-strcpy.c : Write a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.
- Return value: the pointer to dest

100-atoi.c : Write a function that convert a string to an integer.


More pointers, arrays and strings

0-strcat.c : Write a function that concatenates two strings.

1-strncat.c : Write a function that concatenates two strings.

2-strncpy.c : Write a function that copies a string.

3-strcmp.c : Write a function that compares two strings.

4-rev_array.c : Write a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.

5-string_toupper.c : Write a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

6-cap_string.c : Write a function that capitalizes all words of a string.

7-leet.c : Write a function that encodes a string into 1337.
- Letters a and A should be replaced by 4
- Letters e and E should be replaced by 3
- Letters o and O should be replaced by 0
- Letters t and T should be replaced by 7
- Letters l and L should be replaced by 1


Even more pointers, arrays and strings

0-memset.c : Write a function that fills memory with a constant byte.
- The _memset() function fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b
- Returns a pointer to the memory area s

1-memcpy.c : Write a function that copies memory area.
-The _memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest
- Returns a pointer to dest

2-strchr.c : Write a function that locates a character in a string.
- Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string s, or NULL if the character is not found

3-strspn.c : Write a function that gets the length of a prefix substring
- Returns the number of bytes in the initial segment of s which consist only of bytes from accept
